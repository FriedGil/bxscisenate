            <p class="py-8">Each official class elects a Senator who attends Senate meetings once a month, which are run by the Senate Leader, the S.O. President and the S.O. Vice President. The Senatorâ€™s job is to offer opinions on proposals, to inform their class on school happenings, and to bring issues to the attention of the entire Senate. Elections are held at the start of every school year.
